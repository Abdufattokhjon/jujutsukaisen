                Yuji Itadori, a high school student with extraordinary physical abilities, stumbles upon a powerful cursed object—the finger of Ryomen Sukuna, the King of Curses. To protect his friends, he consumes the finger, unknowingly becoming Sukuna’s vessel.

                <h2>Jujutsu High – The School for Sorcerers</h2>
                <h3>Special Grade Teachers</h3>
                <p>
                    Jujutsu High is an elite institution where talented students train to become sorcerers and protect the world from curses. 
                    The school has two main branches: Tokyo Jujutsu High and Kyoto Jujutsu High. Led by powerful sorcerers like Satoru Gojo, 
                    students undergo intense training, learning cursed energy manipulation, combat skills, and exorcism techniques.

                    The school’s instructors are highly skilled, with some being special-grade sorcerers. Satoru Gojo, the strongest sorcerer, 
                    is the main mentor for first-year students like Yuji Itadori, Megumi Fushiguro, and Nobara Kugisaki. 
                    He teaches them how to master their cursed techniques and survive deadly battles against cursed spirits.

                    One of the biggest events in Jujutsu High is the Kyoto Sister-School Exchange Event, where Tokyo and Kyoto students 
                    face off in a friendly yet intense battle. This event showcases their growth and abilities while fostering rivalry and teamwork.

                    Despite being a prestigious school, Jujutsu High is surrounded by corruption and hidden agendas. Some sorcerers manipulate 
                    events for their own gain, and students must navigate these dangers while fulfilling their duties.

                <h2>Satoru Gojo – The Strongest Sorcerer</h2>
                <h3>The Master of Limitless and Six Eyes</h3>
                <p>
                    Satoru Gojo is widely recognized as the most powerful jujutsu sorcerer in the modern era. 
                    As a special-grade sorcerer and teacher at Tokyo Jujutsu High, he plays a vital role in training 
                    young sorcerers and protecting the world from cursed spirits.

                    Limitless (Muryokusho) – A technique inherited from the Gojo family that allows him to manipulate 
                    space at an atomic level. This ability grants him control over Infinity, creating an impenetrable defense.
                    Six Eyes (Rikugan) – A rare ocular ability that enhances his perception and cursed energy control, 
                    allowing him to use Limitless without excessive energy loss.

                    Gojo's Domain Expansion, Unlimited Void (Mugen Kukan), traps his enemies in an overwhelming space filled 
                    with infinite information. Anyone caught inside experiences paralysis due to sensory overload, making them defenseless.
                    Despite his overwhelming power, Gojo is a dedicated teacher. He mentors Yuji Itadori, Megumi Fushiguro, 
                    and Nobara Kugisaki, believing that nurturing strong young sorcerers is the key to changing the corrupt jujutsu society.

                    Although he fights for justice, Gojo often clashes with the higher-ups of the jujutsu society, 
                    believing that their outdated methods only lead to further corruption and suffering. His rebellious nature puts 
                    him at odds with the elders, making him a controversial yet essential figure in the jujutsu world.

            <div class="text">
                <h2>Megumi’s Personality & Role in Jujutsu Society</h2>
                <h3>Ten Shadows Technique (十種影法術 - Tokusa no Kage Bōjutsu)</h3>
                <p>
                    This Zenin Clan inherited technique allows Megumi to summon and control shikigami (shadow-based familiars) 
                    using his shadow. Unlike most jujutsu sorcerers, Megumi can store objects inside his shadow, making his 
                    combat style versatile and unpredictable.

                    Megumi can summon multiple powerful shikigami, including:
                    Divine Dogs – His most commonly used shikigami for tracking and combat.
                    Nue – A large winged shikigami that can carry Megumi and attack enemies with powerful strikes.
                    Toad – A frog-like shikigami that can trap enemies with its tongue.
                    Great Serpent – A snake shikigami used for quick and devastating attacks.
                    Max Elephant – A massive elephant shikigami that can douse enemies with large volumes of water.
                    Mahoraga (八握剣異戒神将魔虚羅) – The strongest and most uncontrollable shikigami. 
                    It adapts to any attack, making it nearly invincible.

                    Megumi’s incomplete domain expansion floods the area with shadows, allowing him to summon multiple shikigami
                    simultaneously and move freely within the domain. Although not fully developed, it is one of the most unique 
                    and versatile domains in Jujutsu Kaisen.

                    Unlike Yuji Itadori, who is optimistic and outgoing, Megumi is serious, strategic, and introverted. 
                    He often acts as the voice of reason in the group, ensuring that his friends stay focused during missions.
                    Despite his calm nature, Megumi has a strong sense of justice and believes in saving those who deserve to be saved. 
                    His ideals clash with the jujutsu society’s rigid rules, making him a rebellious but righteous sorcerer.

                <h2>Yuji Itadori – The Vessel of Sukuna</h2>
                <h3>Who is Yuji Itadori?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yuji Itadori is the main protagonist of Jujutsu Kaisen. He is an incredibly strong and athletic 
                    high school student who unexpectedly becomes the host of Ryomen Sukuna, the King of Curses. 
                    Despite his terrifying fate, Yuji remains kind-hearted, selfless, and determined to protect others.

                    Unlike most sorcerers, Yuji was not born into the jujutsu world, yet his physical abilities surpass even some trained sorcerers. 
                    His natural talent, exceptional strength, and high cursed energy resilience make him an anomaly.
                    Yuji is far stronger and faster than an average human. Even before learning jujutsu, he could:
                    Throw a shot put ball like a bullet.
                    Easily defeat trained athletes in combat.
                    Sprint at incredible speeds.

                    After consuming Sukuna’s fingers, Yuji developed exceptional cursed energy control. His main techniques include:
                    Yuji is Sukuna’s vessel, meaning the King of Curses can take control of his body at times. However, unlike other 
                    Sukuna hosts in history, Yuji can resist and suppress Sukuna’s influence most of the time.

                    Yuji and Aoi Todo team up to battle Hanami, a special-grade curse.
                    First time Yuji successfully uses Black Flash multiple times in a row.
                    Yuji and Nobara Kugisaki fight against special-grade curses, showing incredible teamwork.
                    Nobara uses Resonance while Yuji delivers Black Flash attacks.
                    Yuji personally fights Mahito, who killed his friend Junpei.
                    After witnessing Mahito’s cruelty, Yuji swears to kill him.

                <h2>Nobara Kugisaki – Jujutsu Kaisen</h2>
                <h3>Personality & Traits</h3>
                <p>
                    Nobara Kugisaki is one of the main characters in Jujutsu Kaisen and a first-year student at Tokyo Jujutsu High School. 
                    She is a determined, strong-willed, and confident sorcerer who fights alongside Yuji Itadori and Megumi Fushiguro 
                    under the guidance of Satoru Gojo.

                    Nobara has a fiery and independent personality. She strongly believes in staying true to herself, 
                    refusing to conform to societal expectations about femininity. She values both beauty and strength, 
                    rejecting the idea that women should be weak or submissive. Despite her often blunt and aggressive nature, 
                    she deeply cares for her friends and will do anything to protect them.

                    Nobara uses Straw Doll Technique, which allows her to manipulate cursed energy through tools like nails, 
                    a hammer, and a straw doll. Her fighting style combines precision, strategy, and raw determination, 
                    making her a dangerous opponent. Some of her signature abilities include:
                    Resonance – By linking a nail to a target’s body, she can inflict direct damage from a distance.
                    Hairpin – She detonates multiple nails at once, causing massive area damage.
                    Black Flash (Possibly) – While she hasn’t officially used it, she is skilled enough to potentially perform this technique.

                    Throughout Jujutsu Kaisen, Nobara proves herself as one of the strongest and most resilient characters. 
                    She refuses to be underestimated and holds her own even against powerful cursed spirits. 
                    She plays a vital role in battles, using her intelligence and tactical thinking to gain the upper hand.
